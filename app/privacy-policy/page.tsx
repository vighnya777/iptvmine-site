        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how <strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>IPTVMine Pro</strong> (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) handles information when you use our Android application and website. By using IPTVMine Pro, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong style={{ color: "var(--teal)" }}>We do not sell your personal data.</strong> We are committed to transparency about what limited information we interact with and how it stays under your control.
        </p>

        <h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>
          IPTVMine Pro operates primarily as a local application. We do not require account registration, and no personally identifiable information (name, email, phone number) is required to use the app.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provider URLs and playlist links you add are stored locally on your device only.</li>
          <li>Extension configurations and settings remain on your device.</li>
          <li>No signup, login, or user profile is required or collected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>
          Certain technical information may be automatically collected when the app interacts with third-party provider endpoints or our website:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device type and operating system version (for compatibility purposes).</li>
          <li>Crash reports and error logs (if crash reporting is enabled in your version).</li>
          <li>Network request metadata when fetching M3U playlists or extension manifests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="usage-information">Usage Information</h2>
        <p>
          IPTVMine Pro does not collect analytics or usage telemetry by default. Your streaming activity — which channels you watch, which movies you browse, and which providers you use — is not transmitted to us.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Playback history and watch progress are stored locally on your device.</li>
          <li>Provider preferences and active extensions are saved locally via Android SharedPreferences.</li>
          <li>No usage data is sent to IPTVMine Pro servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="search-history">Search History</h2>
        <p>
          Search queries you enter within IPTVMine Pro are processed locally on your device and used only to filter the content already loaded from your configured providers. Search history:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>May be stored temporarily in device memory during a session.</li>
          <li>Is not transmitted to external servers by IPTVMine Pro itself.</li>
          <li>Note: if your search query is forwarded to a third-party provider extension (e.g. a Vega extension&apos;s <code>getSearchPosts</code> function), that extension may make an external HTTP request containing your query to its own server. We have no control over those third-party provider servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="cookies-analytics">Cookies &amp; Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          The IPTVMine Pro <strong>Android application</strong> does not use browser cookies. The IPTVMine Pro <strong>website</strong> (this page) may use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Essential cookies required for page functionality and security (e.g. Vercel hosting cookies).</li>
          <li>No advertising or tracking cookies.</li>
          <li>No third-party analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, etc.) are currently embedded on this website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can disable cookies in your browser settings without affecting the core functionality of this website.
        </p>

        <h2 id="third-party-services">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          IPTVMine Pro integrates with third-party services to provide content. These services have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>IPTV Providers / M3U Playlist Hosts:</strong> When the app fetches your configured M3U playlist URLs, those servers may log your IP address and request headers.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Vega-Compatible Extensions:</strong> Extensions are third-party JavaScript/TypeScript scrapers. When an extension fetches content, it communicates with the extension author&apos;s chosen website(s). IPTVMine Pro is not responsible for those servers&apos; data practices.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>TMDb / IMDb / Metadata Providers:</strong> Movie and series metadata (titles, posters, synopses, cast information) may be sourced from public APIs such as The Movie Database (TMDb). Their respective privacy policies apply.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>External Links:</strong> This website and the app may contain links to third-party websites. Clicking these links will direct you away from IPTVMine Pro, and we are not responsible for those sites&apos; privacy practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="data-security">Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable steps to protect information. However, as IPTVMine Pro stores most data locally on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your device&apos;s built-in security (screen lock, encryption) is the primary protection for locally stored settings.</li>
          <li>Provider URLs containing authentication tokens should be treated as sensitive — do not share your device&apos;s app data with untrusted parties.</li>
          <li>We use HTTPS for all network requests made by the app and website.</li>
          <li>No database of user accounts or personal data is maintained by IPTVMine Pro because we do not collect it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="user-rights">Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Since IPTVMine Pro does not collect personal data, most traditional data-subject rights (access, deletion, portability) are satisfied by the fact that all your data lives on your device and is under your direct control. Specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Access &amp; Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored settings. Clearing the app&apos;s data in Android Settings achieves the same effect.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Portability:</strong> Your provider list and settings can be exported via Android&apos;s backup features.</li>
          <li><strong style={{ color: "#fff" }}>Opt-out:</strong> No opt-out is needed for analytics or marketing because we do not conduct those activities.</li>
          <li>If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal data, please contact us and we will investigate and delete it promptly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), California (CCPA), and other jurisdictions with specific data rights may contact us to exercise any applicable rights.
        </p>

        <h2 id="contact">Contact Information</h2>
        <p>
          If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@iptvminepro.app">privacy@iptvminepro.app</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          We will respond to all legitimate privacy inquiries within 30 days.
