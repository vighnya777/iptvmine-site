        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h2 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, IPTVMine Pro and its contributors shall not be liable for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h2 id="account-security">Account &amp; Security</h2>
        <p>
          IPTVMine Pro does not currently require user accounts. All configuration is stored locally on your device. However:

        </ul>

        <h2 id="modifications">Modifications to Service</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.</li>
          <li>Announced in the App's release notes for significant changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your continued use of IPTVMine Pro after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the App.
        </p>

        <h2 id="governing-law">Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws. As IPTVMine Pro is an open-source project with a global user base:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You agree to comply with the laws of your local jurisdiction when using the App.</li>
          <li>Any disputes arising from these Terms should first be addressed by contacting us directly.</li>
          <li>If legal proceedings are necessary, the applicable jurisdiction will be determined by the location of the project maintainers at the time of the dispute.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
